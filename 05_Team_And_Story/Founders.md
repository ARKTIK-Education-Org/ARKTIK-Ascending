# The Founders of ARKTIK

## Faith, Grit, and Legacy—The ARKTIK Story Begins Here

ARKTIK was born not from theory, but from lived experience. Our founder, J. Morris, built ARKTIK as both a legacy for future generations and a lifeline for families and communities left behind by conventional systems.  
From Houston, Texas roots to a national movement, ARKTIK stands as a testament to what can be built when faith, discipline, and resilience meet real-world needs.

## J. Morris — Founder & Executive Director

A native of Houston, Texas, J. Morris is the grandson of Dr. Samuel H. Smith Sr., a legendary pastor and street minister who spent over 60 years transforming neighborhoods, changing lives, and standing unafraid in the face of adversity.  
Inspired by his grandfather’s fearless dedication and compassion, J. Morris has lived a life of both challenge and restoration—walking in faith, building systems for those overlooked, and never compromising on dignity.

### Journey

J. Morris’s journey began in Houston but soon stretched across the Midwest and South, serving organizations and communities—from logistics and music publishing to military discipline and educational innovation.  
He has worn many hats: architect, organizer, facilitator, and advocate for the forgotten, the faithful, and the forsaken.

His unique blend of real-world experience—U.S. Air Force Pararescue (PJ) training, entrepreneurship, and a relentless drive for justice—prepared him to build ARKTIK into a living standard, not just a company.  
His own path includes overcoming setbacks, seeking reconciliation, and turning every defeat into an opportunity for new legacy.

## “Set Apart, Never Above”

What sets ARKTIK apart is not perfection, but humility. We are not a company, not a church, not a movement, but a living standard and a way of life—committed to building spaces where the exiled, the shamed, the forgotten, and the ready can find purpose and home.

J. Morris leads ARKTIK with this unshakeable commitment:  
- **Faith and discipline above all**  
- **Courage to challenge broken systems**  
- **Kindness and dignity for every guest, partner, and neighbor**
