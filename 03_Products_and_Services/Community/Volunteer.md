# Volunteer with ARKTIK

## The Three Sides of Restoration: Forgotten, Faithful, and Forsaken

Most only see two sides—those who are lost and those who believe.  
But ARKTIK stands in the center, where a third side is too often hidden:  
**the disabled, the homeless, and the poor.**

**Today, we bring all three into harmony.**

---

### Who Are We Looking For?

- **The Forgotten:**  
  Those who have known exile—incarcerated, rejected, shamed, or made invisible by circumstance or system.

- **The Faithful:**  
  Those who serve, believe, and stand ready to restore—mentors, families, educators, faith leaders, and seekers.

- **The Forsaken:**  
  The disabled, the homeless, the poor—those whom society hides or overlooks, but who carry untold wisdom, strength, and stories.

If you see yourself—or your calling—among these three,  
**ARKTIK is your home for meaningful service, restoration, and legacy.**

## Why Volunteer with ARKTIK?

- **Set Apart, Never Above:**  
  We honor every background, skill, and story. Everyone is valued. Everyone is needed.
- **Hands-On Impact:**  
  Restore dignity. Build gardens and hope. Serve in jails, on the street, at events, or behind the scenes.
- **Flexible Commitment:**  
  Join for a single project, a season, or a lifetime. Every hand advances the return.
- **Genuine Community:**  
  We are not just a movement—we are a family, building generational change together.
