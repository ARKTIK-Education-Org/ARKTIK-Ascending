## How Our Treasury Works

- **Nonprofit-First:**  
  As a 501(c)(3) (pending IRS approval), our treasury holds only donor, grant, and earned income reserves for mission purposes—never for speculation or private gain.

- **Bridge Approach:**  
  We securely hold reserves in a mix of traditional accounts (bank, money market, federally insured deposit) and, when approved and fully compliant, a limited amount in stable digital assets for security and future-proof operations.  
  No tokens, no speculation—just stewardship and resilience.

- **Public, Segregated Accounts:**  
  Each core vertical (Education, MicroFarms, Security, Media, Community) has its own account or sub-ledger. This ensures funds for a cause are never misused or cross-subsidized.

- **Open Reporting:**  
  Quarterly public financial reports detail all reserves, flows, and uses.  
  Annual audits and real-time dashboards (coming soon) will offer even greater transparency.

## Treasury Safeguards

- **Segregated Funds:**  
  Donations and grants are never pooled for non-mission purposes.
- **Access Control:**  
  Only designated fiduciaries (board, controller, legal counsel) may authorize treasury actions.  
- **Risk Controls:**  
  No leverage, derivatives, or speculative investments—ever.
- **Redemption Guarantee:**  
  Donors may request written confirmation of fund segregation and use at any time.

## Our Commitment to Supporters

- **Zero Hype:**  
  We do not offer or endorse speculative or investment products—only stewardship, trust, and impact.
- **Open Books:**  
  All partners, major donors, and auditors may review our reserves and flows upon request, subject to privacy and legal requirements.
- **Bridge for Good:**  
  Our treasury is designed to work seamlessly with both traditional and approved digital finance tools—never compromising security, legality, or our values.
