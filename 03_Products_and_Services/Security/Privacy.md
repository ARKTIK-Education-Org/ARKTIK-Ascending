# ARKTIK Privacy Commitment

## Privacy Is Dignity. Security Without Sacrifice.

At ARKTIK, we believe **privacy is a birthright, not an upgrade.**  
Every family, neighbor, and client deserves to feel safe, respected, and in control of their data—no exceptions, no fine print.

## Our Privacy Principles

- **Your Data, Your Choice:**  
  You control who accesses your video feeds, sensor data, and account information. ARKTIK never shares, sells, or exploits your data—period.
- **Transparency in Practice:**  
  Every setting, permission, and access log is visible and accessible to you at all times. No hidden switches. No silent surveillance.
- **Encrypted by Design:**  
  All data is encrypted at rest and in transit—using Microsoft Azure’s world-class security infrastructure. Only you and your trusted circle hold the keys.
- **No Corporate Backdoors:**  
  ARKTIK does not—and will not—allow third-party or corporate backdoor access to your security, camera, or personal data. Only explicit, user-granted access is possible.
- **Right to Be Forgotten:**  
  You can delete your data, footage, and account at any time. When you’re done, your data is gone—no indefinite retention, no silent archives.
- **Community, Not Corporatism:**  
  Our mesh security solutions empower groups and neighborhoods—but never at the cost of personal privacy. You decide how much to share, and with whom.

## What This Means for You

- **Families:**  
  Only those you trust can see your camera or sensor feeds—no matter what.
- **Community Groups:**  
  Shared data is always opt-in, and you control the mesh network settings for your household.
- **Businesses & Daycares:**  
  Privacy settings ensure that only authorized staff and families have access to sensitive areas.
- **Eldercare & Vulnerable Populations:**  
  Monitoring with dignity: all safety features are discreet, secure, and never shared outside your chosen circle.
